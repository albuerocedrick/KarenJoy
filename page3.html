            My dearest Karen Joy,<br><br>
            Happy Valentine's Karenn! I just want you to know that you mean a lot to me. I just want you to feel my love even though we're far from each other, that's why i made this simple website just for you and I hope that you like it. <br><br>I want to take this moment to remind you how special you are to me. You're a person that brings so much happiness to me. You give time to me whenever i want to talk or to watch with you even though we're not together anymore and no matter what happens, you'll always be part of me. <br><br>I know that i made a lot of mistakes and I am really sorry for that. I truly understand and learned from them. I want to tell you that i have changed and becoming better everyday. I want to show you through my actions not just words. A patient and understanding person for you and also for myself. <br><br> I don't really know  where are you right now and where are you going in the future. I just want to say that I will always support you wherever life takes you. You're a strong person and I know you'll do amazing things. <br><br> no matter how long it takes, I will wait for you. I know love isn‚Äôt something to rush, and I want you to take your time. <br><br> The shelter is ready for whenever you want to come home. I love you so much, Karen Joy Villasoto Ramos <br><br>
            With all my love,<br>
